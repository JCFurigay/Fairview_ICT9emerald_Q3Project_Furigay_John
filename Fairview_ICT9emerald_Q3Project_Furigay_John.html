   	<td>LANY were formed in March 2014 when Paul Jason Klein, who had a small solo career, flew to Nashville to meet up with friends Jake Goss and Les Priest. Previously, Goss and Priest had a separate project by the name of WRLDS, but this was discontinued after the formation of LANY. Klein had been classically trained in piano and had been playing since early childhood. The following month they anonymously uploaded two songs, "Hot Lights" and "Walk Away", to their SoundCloud account with zero followers in order to differentiate between their old and new projects. These two songs were recorded within the space of four days. In an interview, Klein explains that after the release of these singles, they began receiving emails from record labels within six days, of which he still does not know how they found the music. Their debut EP, Acronyms, followed later that year, with the song "ILYSB" generating significant interest online, reaching more than 100,000 hits. Singles "Made in Hollywood" and "Bad, Bad, Bad" soon followed, along with the reveal of their identities.</td>
